Here is my site, this is my place on the internet.


### Thinks I like...
* [Python](https://python.org) - I think this is a beautiful language.
* [JavaScript](https://javascript.org) - because you are pretty much required to know it anymore!
* BPMN Tools like [Camunda](https://camunda.com) because I can build as fast as I think, then adapt quickly.
* [Docker](https://docker.com) and I need to learn [Kubernettes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/)...
* [GO](https://golang.org/) - starting to get an interest in it....

and when I am required...

* [JAVA](https://www.java.com) for work
* [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) I used to use it ([C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) and [VB.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/)) and think it is still a good platform... even VB.NET.

I should mention that I also love [Excel](https://products.office.com/en-us/excel). Really it is a great tool... just don't run your business on it.
