### I like...
* [Python](https://python.org) - I think this is a beautiful language.
* [JavaScript](https://javascript.org) - because you are pretty much required to know it anymore!
* BPMN Tools like [Camunda](https://camunda.com) because I can build as fast as I think, then adapt quickly.
* [Docker](https://docker.com) and I need to learn Kubernettes...

and when I am required too...
* JAVA for work
* .NET I used to use it (C# and VB.NET)

I should mention that I also love [Excel](https://products.office.com/en-us/excel). Really it is a great tool... just don't run your business off it.
